<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tips for managing low blood sugar</h2>
<p>A person experiencing a minor case of low blood sugar can consume 15&ndash;20 grams (g) of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as a small glass of fruit juice or a few crackers.</p>
<p>If a person is still experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar after 15 minutes, they can eat another 15&ndash;20 g portion of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Following a hypoglycemia diet will help to manage symptoms and prevent blood sugar from dropping.</p>
<p>Reducing simple sugars and increasing complex carbohydrates can help control blood sugar levels throughout the day and prevent any sudden spikes or dips.</p>
<p>A person with hypoglycemia can try the following lifestyle considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>eating frequent meals</li>
<li>avoiding high sugar foods, including sweets, sugary drinks, and fruit juices with added sugar</li>
<li>choosing foods with low GI scores</li>
<li>reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
<p>Eating or drinking a small amount of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as a piece of fruit or fruit juice, can treat minor cases of hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>However, anyone experiencing more severe or regular symptoms should see their doctor, as soon as possible. Hypoglycemia is a manageable condition, and getting an early diagnosis means the symptoms can be controlled.</p>
<p>Left untreated, the symptoms of hypoglycemia can become more frequent and dangerous. The symptoms also mimic other conditions, so it is important for a doctor to diagnose the condition and rule out other possible causes.</p>
