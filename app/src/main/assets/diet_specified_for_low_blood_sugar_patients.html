<h3 style="text-align: center;">Diet Specified for Low Blood Sugar Patients</h3>
<p>People with persistent low blood sugar may have hypoglycemia. Having low blood sugar is often associated with diabetes, but it is possible to experience hypoglycemia without having diabetes.</p>
<p>Other common causes include hormonal deficiencies, critical illnesses, and excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
<h4>1. Breakfast</h4>
<p>A person should always try to eat breakfast as soon as possible after waking up, as blood sugar levels may have dropped during the night.</p>
<p>It is advisable to limit intake of fruit juices in the morning and stick to juices that do not have added sugar, as these may cause blood sugar levels to become unstable.</p>
<p>Some ideal breakfast choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>hard-boiled eggs and whole-grain toast</li>
<li>oatmeal with berries, sunflower seeds, agave, and cinnamon</li>
<li>Greek yogurt with berries, honey, and oatmeal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Lunch</strong></p>
<p>Lunch should be a small meal but packed with protein, healthful fats, and complex carbohydrates that will continue to release energy slowly.</p>
<p>Some good lunch ideas for hypoglycemia are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tuna, chicken, or tofu sandwich on whole-grain bread with salad leaves</li>
<li>chickpea and vegetable salad</li>
<li>grilled fish, a baked sweet potato, and a side salad</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary for a person with hypoglycemia to be aware of the glycemic index or GI of the foods they eat. Some foods that appear to be healthful may have a high GI. Fortunately, there is often an alternative that has a lower GI.</p>
<p>For example, sweet potatoes have a relatively low GI and are full of antioxidants, making them a better choice than other types of potato, such as white russet potatoes, which have a high GI.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dinner</strong></p>
<p>While it may be tempting to eat more in the evenings, a person with hypoglycemia should keep their evening meals small. A good dinner choice will include protein and complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Dinner ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>chicken or tofu with brown rice and vegetables</li>
<li>salmon with steamed vegetables or salad</li>
<li>a bean stew with lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas, and tinned tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Snacks</strong></p>
<p>People with hypoglycemia should try to include small, nutritious snacks in between meals to keep blood sugar levels constant and ensure they are having enough vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, proteins, and fibrous carbohydrates in their diet.</p>
<p>Eating one snack mid-morning, another mid-afternoon, and something small close to bedtime can help keep blood sugar levels stable throughout both the day and night.</p>
<p>Some healthy snack options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a small apple with a few slices of cheddar cheese</li>
<li>a banana with a handful of nuts or seeds</li>
<li>a slice of wholegrain toast with mashed avocado or hummus</li>
<li>whole-grain crackers topped with a small can of sardines or tuna</li>
<li>carrots, peppers, and cucumber dipped in hummus</li>
<li>a vegetable smoothie</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that people who exercise regularly may need to eat more frequently, as strenuous or sustained physical activity can cause blood sugar levels to drop.</p>
<p>A person should eat a small snack that includes carbs and protein before a workout. Good choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a piece of fruit or handful of berries and whole-grain crackers</li>
<li>Greek yogurt mixed with berries</li>
<li>an apple with a spoonful of peanut butter and a slice of cheese</li>
<li>a small handful of mixed dried fruit and nuts</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercising on a full stomach is not advisable, so keeping pre-exercise snacks small and remembering to stay hydrated by drinking lots of water are important.</p>
